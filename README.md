# Discourse Forums CLA

[cla.txt](https://github.com/discourse/core-cla/blob/master/cla.txt) contains the official **Discourse Contributor 
License Agreement** paper, and is what new users should be completing. For now, the latest version of this will be found
in the `master` branch--this may change in the future; we will update these instructions if/when that happens.

# How to Submit

  1. Print the CLA.
  2. Complete the CLA, sign it, scan it back to PDF, and e-mail it to `team@discourse.org`.

# After We Receive the CLA

  1. Each received CLA that is complete and signed will be placed in the `collected/cla/XYZ` where `XYZ` is name of the signee.
  2. Verify your CLA is in this directory. If/when it is, you are officially a part of the Discourse contribution community!

# To Do

At some point in the near future, we may allow this process through pull requests.
